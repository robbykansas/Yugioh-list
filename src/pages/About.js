          <h4>What Is Yu-Gi-Oh</h4> <br/>
          <p>
            Yu-Gi-Oh! is a popular children’s franchise. It’s based on a universe in which characters challenge one another to a strategy card game to gain honor, settle disputes, and protect their loved ones. The Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise began with a manga series (similar to a series of American comic books) and expanded into a television series. To date, there are 4 different series of the animated Yu-Gi-Oh! television show, each featuring different characters. These series include the original animated Yu-Gi-Oh! series, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s, and Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal. In each series, the main protagonist is a young kid or teenager who dreams big, sets goals, and strategizes to accomplish those goals. These protagonists compete in high-stakes strategy card games called “Duels,” always while maintaining a strong moral compass, a commitment to their friends, and an understanding of the importance of good sportsmanship. For more information about the manga series or each animated Yu-Gi-Oh! series, check out “New to the Yu-Gi-Oh! Manga Series” and “New to the Yu-Gi-Oh! Animated Series” in the New to Yu-Gi-Oh! area. <br /> <br />

            In addition to a manga and television show, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise contains several video games. These video games include Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s Decade Duels Plus (available for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3), Yu-Gi-Oh! BAM (playable through Facebook and Kongregate and available on iOS devices), and the Duel Terminal Arcade Machine, playable at certain hobby stores. Each of these video games requires players to think strategically to succeed. For more information about Yu-Gi-Oh! video games, check out “New to Yu-Gi-Oh! Video Games” in the New to Yu-Gi-Oh! area. <br /> <br />

            The Yu-Gi-Oh! TRADING CARD GAME combines everything that’s exciting about the Yu-Gi-Oh! brand. It lets kids relive the intense card game Duels from the TV show; teaches them to think strategically to succeed; encourages them to forge friendships with peers who have a common interest in the card game (just like the characters do in the manga and the Yu-Gi-Oh! animated series); and allows them to set and achieve goals as they become contenders in Yu-Gi-Oh! TRADING CARD GAME tournaments. Kids can collect their favorite Monster Cards, Spell Cards, and Trap Cards from the show, then combine them into a custom Deck to Duel against their friends. Each Deck is unique, built from a pool of thousands of possible cards. Your child’s Deck is the product of his or her creativity and ingenuity. <br /> <br />

          <h4>What Is a Trading Card Games</h4><br/>
          <p>
          A trading card game (TCG) is a unique product that encourages interaction and socialization between the people who play it. Unlike a board game or video game which begin and end in one box, TCGs are constantly changing, adding new and exciting content. Trading card game players can start with ready-made Starter or Structure decks, and then add to those Decks using new cards from booster packs. New booster packs with all-new cards are released several times a year, keeping the play environment fresh and exciting. New cards lead to new possibilities, making the potential for new Decks and strategies limitless. <br /> <br />

          Some Duelists focus on collecting all the cards, while others prefer to collect the cards they want to use in their Decks. Collecting is an enjoyable activity all by itself, but the cards are designed with gameplay in mind. It’s a lot of fun to take that collection, build some Decks, and play some games!<br /> <br />
